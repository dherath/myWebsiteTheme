## Research Interests

<p align="justify">My research work at SUNY Binghamton would generally fall under the categories of Internet of Things(IoT), smart grids while during my undergrad days I was part of the robotics research group where I simulated different movement algorithms for biologically inspired snake robots. If you're interested in my work please visit my research gate page, where I'd be happy to share my work with anyone interested.</p>
